# Toronto-Crime-Rates
## Learning objective: 
To gain experience loading, preparing and visualising a publicly available dataset in order to meet a primary objective. 

## Primary Goal: 
To present an overall picture of the crime rates in Toronto from 2014 to 2018 using major crime indicators (MCI).

In order to meet the primary goal, I broke this analysis down into a number of objectives:

- What are the most common crimes in Toronto?
- Break down each crime into charge
- Has there been a decrease in crime over the past number of years
- What time of the year the frequency of crime is highest? 
- Does it has anything to do with time of the day?
- Which neighborhoods experience the highest crime rates in Toronto?   
- Present a clear visualisation of Toronto crime.

### This project is split into the following Notebooks:

#### Part 1: Toronto's Major Crime Indicators Compared

#### Part 2: Toronto Assault Overview 

#### Part 3: Toronto's Neighbourhood Crime Rates Analysed & Mapped

## Key Takeaways:

- Crime in Toronto is steadily increasing which is evident from the increase in each MCI incidences over the past number of years.
- Assault was the most frequent MCI from 2014 - 2018 and shows no evidence of decreasing.
- The number of offences for each MCI dipped during the colder months (January and February) until rising again, typically during May, June and August. 
- The first of every month usually has the highest count of offences.
- While crime descreases late into the night, a spike in crime typically occurs during midday and during the later hours of the evening.
- Some of the neighbourhoods with the highest crime rate include:
    - Church-Yonge Corridor
    - Waterfront Communities-The Island 
    - West Humber-Clairville
    - Moss Park 
    - Bay Street Corridor	
- By examining both the interactive and scatter map, it was clear that there were a number of high-density areas, the most clear being downtown.
